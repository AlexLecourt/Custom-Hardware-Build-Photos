## **Conclusion** 🎉  

Building these PCs has been so much more than just assembling hardware—it’s been about sharing my passion with the people I care about most. Whether it was brainstorming designs, troubleshooting late into the night, or seeing their excitement when the final product came to life, every project brought incredible memories.  

There were so many more builds than the ones here, but I picked just a few highlights to share. Each of these "beauties" is a piece of that journey, and they all hold a special place in my heart.
